              <strong>Nickel</strong> is a lustrous chemical element with a
              slight golden tinge. <strong>Nickel Alloy</strong> is designed
              with high-concentration of nickel and with combinations of
              chromium and molybdenum. These alloys are also mixed with copper
              and a few other elements. This gives these alloys superior
              protection against corrosion and oxidations in different
              environments. The Ni Alloy has superior mechanical properties.
              These alloys possess superior tensile and yield strength. They
              have improved magnetic and electronic properties. The{" "}
              <strong>Nickel Steel Alloy</strong> is highly versatile and can be
              drawn in different shapes to be used in different applications.
              They are widely used in heavy forgings, turbine blades, propeller
              shafts, fasteners, etc. We are the top{" "}
              <strong>Nickel suppliers in India</strong>. Our institution aims
              at supplying top-quality at the most reasonable rates.

            <p>
              <strong>Nickel 201</strong> is an alloy of nickel that is produced
              with a concentration of 0.02% carbon. This alloy is highly ductile
              and is neutral in moderate reducing environments This Alloy 201 is
              ferromagnetic and can suffice in high as well as low temperatures.
              These alloys are resistant to mineral acids and alkalis at room
              temperature. They can be easily elongated by 50% after the
              annealing process. High Nickel Alloys can be formed by hot and
              cold rolling processes. These alloys have higher resistance
              against corrosion and creep rupture. These alloys can be polished
              to give them a smooth and aesthetic finish.{" "}
              <strong>Nickel Based Alloys</strong> are designed with superior
              strength. These alloys are easy to maintain and have a long
              service life. All our products can be customized in different
              shapes and sizes to suit all your requirements.

              The <strong>Nickel Alloy Price per Kg</strong> is available
              between Rs 2000 to Rs 2500. The thickness, size, and other
              features influence the pricing of the products in this grade.
